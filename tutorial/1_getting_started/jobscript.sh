# This first line is called a "shebang" and indicates what interpreter to use
# when running this file as an executable. This is needed to be able to submit
# a text file with `sbatch`

# The necessary flags to send to sbatch can either be included when calling
# sbatch or more conveniently it can be specified in the jobscript as follows

#SBATCH -A NAISS2024-22-219    # find your project with the "projinfo" command
#SBATCH -p alvis               # what partition to use (usually not necessary)
#SBATCH -t 0-00:01:00          # how long time it will take to run
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=T4:1   # choosing no. GPUs and their type
#SBATCH -J my_first_job        # the jobname (not necessary)

# The rest of this jobscript is handled as a usual bash script that will run
# on the primary node (in this case there is only one node) of the allocation
# Here you should make sure to run what you want to be run
